## Installation

Add [gem "readme_yard"](https://rubygems.org/gems/readme_yard) to your Gemfile and run `bundle install` or install it yourself with: `gem install readme_yard`

## Getting Started

Run `readme build` at the command line. This creates a README_YARD.md file if there isn‚Äôt one by copying your exisiting README.md file.

README_YARD.md is the template from which `readme build` generates the README. Readme Yard adds the ability to embed and reference your source code in your README via README_YARD.md.

See [Tag Usage](#tag-usage).

## Tag Usage

Readme Yard uses YARD tags and custom markdown tags. YARD tags live inside Ruby source code. The markdown tags live inside README_YARD.md.

When the Readme Yard build process encounters a tag in README_YARD.md, it searches the Ruby source code for its YARD tag counterpart, formats the output, and embeds it in the README file.

### Examples

The next line is a code snippet if you‚Äôre looking at [README.md](https://github.com/mattruzicka/README/blob/main/README_YARD.md) and `{@readme ReadmeYard.hello_world}` if you‚Äôre looking at [README_YARD.md](https://github.com/mattruzicka/readme_yard/blob/main/README_YARD.md).

{@readme ReadmeYard.hello_world}

The markdown tag tells Readme Yard to parse the `@readme` tag located above the `hello_world` class method located in [lib/readme_yard.rb](https://github.com/mattruzicka/readme_yard/blob/main/lib/readme_yard.rb).

To use another "meta" example, `{@readme ReadmeYard}` is used at the top of this project's README_YARD.md file to generate the first few sentences of this README. `ReadmeYard` references the class located in [lib/readme_yard.rb](https://github.com/mattruzicka/readme_yard/blob/main/lib/readme_yard.rb).

Last one, `{@readme ReadmeYard#command_line_usage}` is used to generate the "Command Line Usage" section above from the comments of the `command_line_usage` instance method located in [lib/readme_yard.rb](https://github.com/mattruzicka/readme_yard/blob/main/lib/readme_yard.rb). This method is extra meta: it returns the result of formatting its own comments as markdown. In this way, the usage instructions in the comments, the README, and as printed at the command line will always be in sync.

## Readme Tag

**Markdown** syntax: `{@readme ObjectPath}`

**YARD** syntax: `@example <name>`

{@readme ReadmeYard::ReadmeTag}

### {@readme ReadmeYard::CommentTag}

Example usage:

{@example ReadmeYard::CommentTag}

This example ["@readme comment" tag](https://github.com/mattruzicka/readme_yard/blob/main/lib/readme_yard/comment_tag.rb) embeds the below code snippet via the `{@readme ReadmeYard::CommentTag.format_tag_markdown}` markdown tag.

{@readme ReadmeYard::CommentTag.format_tag_markdown}

### {@readme ReadmeYard::SourceTag}

Example usage:

{@example ReadmeYard::SourceTag}

This example ["@readme source" tag](https://github.com/mattruzicka/readme_yard/blob/main/lib/readme_yard/source_tag.rb) embeds the below code snippet via the `{@readme ReadmeYard::SourceTag.format_tag_markdown}` markdown tag.

{@readme ReadmeYard::SourceTag.format_tag_markdown}

### {@readme ReadmeYard::ObjectTag}

Example usage:

{@example ReadmeYard::ObjectTag}

This example ["@readme object" tag](https://github.com/mattruzicka/readme_yard/blob/main/lib/readme_yard/object_tag.rb) embeds the below code snippet via the `{@readme ReadmeYard::ObjectTag.format_tag_markdown}` markdown tag.

{@readme ReadmeYard::ObjectTag.format_tag_markdown}


---

## Example Tag

**Markdown** syntax: `{@example ObjectPath}`

**YARD** example: `@example`

{@readme ReadmeYard.hello_world}

The below example code is generated from `{@example ReadmeYard.hello_world}` because, as you can see above, the "hello_world" class method has an `@example` tag.

{@example ReadmeYard.hello_world}
